* **features** - A feature would describe the current test script which has to be executed. (files .feature ext) goes here, 
* **features/_step_definitions** - you can define step defintion under this package for your feature steps.
* **features/support/env_vars** - here we define the initial settings as the browser settings and the call of the modules.
* **features/support/hooks** - Define actions after/before each feature/scenario/tag.
* **services/_env_vars** - With this file we call for the use of environment variables.
* **services/_helpers** - Create modules and methods that you think can be used for many steps/features.
* **_views/_views** - Here you must define all those methods that are reused in a specific feature and are not transversal to the project.
* **/env** - here we define all the environment variables to be used throughout the project.
* **/Gemfile** - In this file is To define the dependencies (gems) used in the project


## Running test

Go to your project directory from terminal and hit following commands
* `bundle install`  - Bundler manages an application's dependencies through its entire life, across many machines, systematically and repeatably
* `bundle exec cucumber` - Run all features.
* `bundle exec cucumber features/xxxx.feature`  - to run specific feature.
* `pending uploading of information` to generate a HTML report.
